                    <p>No, you do not need to work out every day. In fact, in most cases, I would recommend at least 1-2 days of total rest a week. However, just because you have a rest or recovery day scheduled into your calendar, doesn’t necessarily mean you aren’t active at all on these days. Light, regular movement such as walking your dog around the block, or taking time for stretching or foam rolling are great recovery techniques to help increase blood flow and reduce tension in tight muscles. Participating in regular rest days and practicing a well-balanced recovery routine can help you reduce your risk for injury and promote the longevity of your fitness routine.</p>

                    <div class="faq-detail">
                        <p>In general, your workouts do not need to be long to be effective. Many people who are new to fitness imagine slogging around for hours on the treadmill. This doesn’t need to be the case.

                            The length of your workout will largely depend on your fitness level, as well as the type of training and intensity you’re working out at. The CDC recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity 5 days a week, as well as 2 full body strength training sessions(1). Making sure you’re hitting these minimums for exercise is a great way to make sure you’re on track. However, if you’re under the recommendation, it’s okay, we all must start somewhere!
                            
                            When it comes to the type of workout you’re completing - HIIT, circuit training sessions, or sprints will typically be quicker than moderate-intensity cardio sessions, as you’re working out at a higher intensity. For strength training sessions, you may want to schedule more time for warming up and resting between sets.

                            <div class="faq-detail">
                                <p>Adding heavy strength training into your routine is just one way to increase lean muscle mass. But there are many ways to increase strong lean muscle tone in your body. Any form of resistance that your muscles must fight against that is greater than what they normally experience, can help stimulate the muscle growth process. Completing exercises with your body weight or resistance bands are also effective ways of training to build strength. Start with what you feel most comfortable with and continue building from there. As your exercises or the weight, you’re using start to feel too easy, increase your weight or choose more challenging exercises to continue challenging your muscles and see results.</p>

                                        <p>When strength training, it’s important to always remember that the workout you’re performing is ‘your workout’. Don’t focus on the number of weight others are using to complete workouts. Instead, focus on your rate of perceived exertion on a scale of 1 to 10. When strength training, you should feel a perceived exertion of 7 to 9, each rep should feel challenging with the last reps and sets feeling significantly harder. If you complete a workout and aren’t feeling challenged, you know it’s time to move up in weight the next time you complete that workout.</p>

                                            <div class="faq-detail">
                                                <p>When it comes to muscle soreness, a few things will factor in to help you recover your best. First, dialing in your nutrition is key, eating foods to fuel your body and workouts is important as this will give your muscles the nutrients they need for recovery. Rest and plenty of sleep will also play into your recovery as well, as when you’re at a full rest you’re giving your muscles that time they need to repair.

                                                        <p>It can take anywhere from 6-8 weeks or more to see results from your program. That can be discouraging as so many of us are living in an instant world - we expect results and changes instantaneously. Don’t get discouraged. Know that your hard work is paying off, even if you don’t see the results you’re looking for on the scale right away.

                                                            A few other ways to track your progress as you go can be the fit of your clothing, being able to complete more challenging or longer workouts, or taking progress photos and comparing as you continue your journey. It’s all the little wins along the way that help keep you going, so keep cueing into your body and all of the smaller successes and changes you see along the way and celebrate them!</p>
