        <h2>BICYCLE CRUNCH</h2>

        <div class="what">
            <p>The bicycle crunch is a great exercise to challenge your core, especially your obliques, in a rotational pattern. The bicycle crunch is performed similarly to a standard crunch, but involves moving your legs in a cycling-like motion while twisting your upper body to each side. This extra rotation is what allows you to activate and strengthen your oblique muscles more than youâ€™re able to when you simply crunch forward.</p>

            <h4><b>HOW TO DO</b></h4>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Contract your core muscles, drawing in your abdomen to stabilize your spine.
                    Hold your head gently with your hands. Pull your shoulder blades back and slowly raise your knees to about a 90-degree angle, lifting your feet from the floor.
                    </li>
                <li>Exhale and slowly, at first, go through a bicycle pedal motion, bringing one knee up towards your armpit while straightening the other leg, keeping both elevated higher than your hips.
                </li>
                <li>Rotate your torso so you can touch your elbow to the opposite knee as it comes up.</li>
                <li>Twist to the other side, while drawing that knee towards your armpit and the other leg extended until your elbow touches the alternate knee.</li>
              </ul></p>
