            <p>A burpee is essentially a two-part exercise: a pushup followed by a leap in the air.

                Doing several burpees in a row can be tiring, but this versatile exercise may be worth the payoff, especially if you’re looking for a way to build strength and endurance, while burning calories, and boosting your cardio fitness.</p><br>

            <h4><b>HOW TO DO</b></h4>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Start in a squat position with your knees bent, back straight, and your feet about shoulder-width apart.
                    Lower your hands to the floor in front of you so they’re just inside your feet.</li>
                <li>With your weight on your hands, kick your feet back so you’re on your hands and toes, and in a pushup position. </li>
                <li>Keeping your body straight from head to heels, do one pushup. Remember not to let your back sag or to stick your butt in the air.
                    Do a frog kick by jumping your feet back to their starting position.</li>
                <li>
                    Stand and reach your arms over your head.
                    Jump quickly into the air so you land back where you started.
                </li>
              </ul></p>

            <p> 
                <ol>
                <li>Get your Heart Rate up.Burpees combine both cardio and strength training. When done properly and consistently, the exercise provides a high-intensity workout that is sure to not only condition your muscles, but also get your heart pumping, your lungs working, and the sweat flowing.</li>
                <li>Burn Calories and Fat.Because burpees double as cardio and strength training, the exercise is a go-to choice for folks who want to burn calories and fat. 

                    In just one minute, you might be able to burn upwards of 15 calories. Over time, this will mean helping you lose fat. </li>
                <li>Improve Mobility and Posture.Because burpees target so many muscles and involve a wide range of motion, they can help improve your mobility, balance, and coordination.</li>
                <li>Work on Core.Your core muscles are important for providing stability and reducing the risk of injuries. Burpees are an effective workout for your core muscles, as you’ll need to keep your core engaged from start to finish. </li>
