        <div class="what">
            <p>The squat is a fundamental movement pattern that requires multiple joint and muscle integration. Babies squat perfectly. And then we unlearn this in favor of bending over.

                As a dynamic strength training exercise, squats require several muscles in your upper and lower body to work together simultaneously.
                
                Many of these muscles help power you through daily tasks such as walking, climbing stairs, bending, or carrying heavy loads. They also help you perform athletic-related activities.</p>

            <h4><b>HOW TO DO</b></h4>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Start with feet slightly wider than hip-width apart, toes turned slightly out.</li>
                <li>Keeping your chest up and out and the pressure even in your feet, engage your abdominals and shift your weight back into your heels as you push your hips back.</li>
                <li>Lower yourself into a squat until either your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward. Your depth should be determined by your form.</li>
                <li>Keep your chest out and core tight as you push through your heels to stand back up to your starting position. Squeeze your glutes at the top</li>
              </ul></p>

            <h4><b>ADVANTAGES</b></h4>
            
            <p> 
                <ol>
                <li>Strengthens your core
                    Having strong core muscles can make everyday movements like turning, bending, and even standing easier. Not only that, but a strong core can improve your balance, ease pain in your low back, and also make it easier to maintain good posture.</li>
                <li> Reduces the risk of injury
                    When you strengthen the muscles in your lower body, youâ€™re better able to execute full-body movements with correct form, balance, mobility, and posture.</li>
                <li>Crushes calories
                    Calorie burning is often equated with aerobic exercises such as running or cycling. But performing high-intensity, compound movements like the squat can also crush some serious calories.</li>
                <li> Boosts athletic ability and strength
                    If you compete in a sport, adding jump squats to your workout may help you develop explosive strength and speed which, in turn, may help improve your athletic performance.</li>
