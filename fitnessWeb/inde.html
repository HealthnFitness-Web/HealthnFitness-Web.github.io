  <img src="pushup.jpg" alt="Push-Up Exercise">
  <p><strong>Muscle Group:</strong> Chest, Shoulders, Triceps</p>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> The push-up is a classic bodyweight exercise that strengthens the chest, shoulders, and triceps. Begin in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart and your body in a straight line from head to heels. Lower your chest towards the ground by bending your elbows, then push back up to the starting position.</p>
  <p><strong>Variations:</strong> There are many variations of push-ups, including incline push-ups, decline push-ups, and diamond push-ups, which target different muscle groups and provide varying levels of difficulty.</p>
  <p><strong>Tips:</strong> Keep your core engaged and your body in a straight line throughout the movement. Focus on maintaining proper form and controlled movement to maximize the effectiveness of the exercise.</p>
