            <p>Butt kicks, also known as butt kickers, are a type of plyometric exercise designed to activate your lower-body muscles. Although the butt kick exercise is useful within a dynamic running drill routine, it also works well as a stand-alone bodyweight exercise. Practice butt kicks by lifting one heel up toward your glutes, gently placing that foot back on the ground, and repeating the movement with your other leg.</p>

            <h4><b>HOW TO DO</b></h4>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Stand in a starting position with your feet hip-width apart and your knees slightly bent. Your shoulders should be directly over your hips with a neutral head and neck position. Your chin should remain tucked throughout the movement, as if you were holding an egg under your chin.</li>
                <li>Engage your core and lift your right heel off the floor toward your glutes. Place the ball of your right foot back onto the ground. Keep your arms by your sides with your elbows bent at a 90-degree angle. </li>
                <li>Repeat this movement with your left foot, raising it toward your glutes and then returning it gently to the ground.</li>
                <li>Continue alternating your feet with this movement pattern back and forth. Once youâ€™re comfortable with the movement, speed up the pace until it feels like you are jogging in place. Remember to land gently on the balls of your feet with every repetition.</li>
              </ul></p>
