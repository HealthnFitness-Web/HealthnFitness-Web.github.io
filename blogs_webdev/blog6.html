<p>Macronutrients are the three types of nutrients that provide your body with most of its energy:  carbohydrates, protein, and fat. Micronutrients, on the other hand, are the types of nutrients that your body uses in smaller amounts, like vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytochemicals. All of the foods we eat fall into at least one of the macronutrient categories, and sometimes all three. Your food choices are classified according to the macronutrient that is most prevalent. For instance, chicken is a protein even though it also has some fat, and sweet potatoes are considered a carbohydrate even though they have a bit of protein.Understanding the role that macronutrients play in achieving optimal health will help you determine the right balance for you and your body. Healthy, unprocessed carbohydrates such as whole grains, leafy greens, and vegetables not only provide the body with energy but are also an excellent source of vitamins and minerals.</p>
