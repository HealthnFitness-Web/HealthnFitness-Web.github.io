<p>Habits are automatic behaviors that we engage in without much conscious thought. They are formed through repeated actions and play a crucial role in our daily lives.Creating healthy habits that stick requires an understanding of what habits are and how they work. There are three components of a habit: cue, routine, and reward.Cue: The cue triggers the habit. Routine: The routine is the behavior itself. Reward.The reward is the positive outcome that reinforces the behavior. For example if you have a habit of snacking before bedtime, the cue might be feeling hungry, the routine might be reaching for a bag of chips, and the reward might be the satisfying crunch and flavor.By understanding the components of a habit, we can begin to identify our own habits, make intentional changes, and create new, healthy habits.</p>
